DOING:
- add press x to exit on game over screen
- add press to restart on game over screen
- add tick on health win (buff)

TODO:
- refactor with system sets ?
- Graphics & anims !!
- Audio


-----

Graphic ideas :
- hand drawing depending on health (more or less tired)
- hand receiving shot animation
- dodge/protect sacrifices a minion ? a finger (isn't a finger the health) ?
- regrows on winning dodge
- shoot sacrifices ?
- look based on buff also (add something to hand)
