Win/Lose event
- despawn everything ?
- spawn winning screen with which player won
-

Graphic ideas :
- hand drawing depending on health (more or less tired)
- hand receiving shot animation
- dodge/protect sacrifices a minion ? a finger (isn't a finger the health) ?
- regrows on winning dodge
- shoot sacrifices ?
- look based on buff also (add something to hand)
